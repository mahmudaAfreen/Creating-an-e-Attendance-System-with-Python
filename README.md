# Creating an e-Attendance System with Python


# Overview 

#### Introduction
Welcome to a fascinating project that involves creating a Face Recognition Attendance System using Python. In simple terms, we're building a system that can recognize and identify people based on their unique facial features. This project is especially exciting because it aims to upgrade the way organizations track attendance using advanced facial recognition technology.

#### Objective
The primary goal here is to improve the attendance tracking system in organizations. Traditional methods of taking attendance can be a bit tricky and time-consuming. So, we're turning to face recognition to make the process more efficient and accurate. The idea is to use the distinctive features of people's faces to take attendance automatically.

#### How It Works
Imagine taking a selfie, and the system automatically figures out who you are by comparing your face with faces it already knows. That's essentially how our attendance system works. It captures and analyzes facial features to confirm the identity of employees and record their attendance without any manual effort.

#### Benefits
The cool thing about this system is that it's super accurate. It reduces mistakes that can happen when humans manually track attendance. Plus, it's way faster! Another advantage is that it cuts down on the need for people to do the attendance work, letting the system handle the complicated parts.

#### Conditions for Optimal Performance
Here's a little tip for the system to work its best: make sure the area where employees are getting their pictures taken is well-lit. Good lighting helps the system see and understand facial features clearly, ensuring accurate identification.

#### Why Facial Recognition?
So, why go for facial recognition? Well, it solves problems we often face with traditional attendance methods. It's like upgrading from a manual typewriter to a fancy computer. Facial recognition not only saves time and effort but also makes the attendance process smoother and more reliable.

## Software Dependencies
**Step 1: Install C++ Compiler (Visual Studio)**
1. [Download](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)the Visual Studio Community Edition.
2. Run the installer and select 'Desktop development with C++'.
3. Allow the installer to download and install the necessary components (This may take some time).
4. After installation, restart your computer.

**Step 2: Set Up Python Environment (PyCharm)**
1. Open your PyCharm project.
2. Install the required Python packages using the following commands
```
pip install cmake
pip install dlib
pip install face_recognition
pip install numpy opencv-python
```
**Step 3: Install PyBuilder**
1. Install PyBuilder using the following command:
```
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
pip install pybuilder
pyb
pyb --start-project
```
2. Build the project using:
```
pyb publish
```
***You must install it using a virtual environment***
